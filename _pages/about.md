Hello! I'm a researcher fascinated by the mathematics of **collective behavior** and **distributed and biologically inspired computation**, including human and animal social decision-making, pattern formation in networked and spatiotemporal systems, self-organization in swarms, and reservoir computing. My focus is on **nonlinearity** and how it shapes emergent collective and computational properties shared by systems across different contexts. I use a combination of tools from nonlinear dynamics, control theory, network science, data-driven equation discovery, and machine learning to *study* real-world and artificially intelligent systems and to *design* decentralized control strategies for autonomous teams. 

In October 2022 I started my current postdoctoral position with the [AI Institute in Dynamic Systems](http://dynamicsai.org/) at the University of Washington, working with Professors [Steve Brunton](https://www.eigensteve.com/) and [J. Nathan Kutz](https://amath.washington.edu/people/j-nathan-kutz). If you would like to explore potential collaboration at some intersection of collective behavior, swarm intelligence, control, distributed learning, equation discovery, and nonlinear systems, please reach out to me at *anabiz [at] uw [dot] edu*. 

Before joining the University of Washington, I received my Ph.D. in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering from Princeton University in September 2022. At Princeton my research on nonlinear dynamics of collective decision-making and belief formation was supervised by Professor [Naomi Ehrich Leonard](https://naomi.princeton.edu/). You can read my Ph.D thesis [here](https://naomi.princeton.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/744/2022/09/AnastasiaThesis.pdf). Prior to my Ph.D. I earned a B.A. in Physics with a minor in Mechanical Engineering from the University of California, Berkeley in 2016.
