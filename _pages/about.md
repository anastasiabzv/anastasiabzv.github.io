Hello! I'm an assistant professor in the [Sibley School of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering](https://www.mae.cornell.edu/mae) at Cornell University. I am fascinated by the mathematics of **collective behavior** and **distributed and biologically inspired computation**, including human and animal social decision-making, pattern formation in networked and spatiotemporal systems, self-organization in swarms, and reservoir computing. My focus is on **nonlinearity** and how it shapes emergent collective and computational properties shared by systems across different contexts. I use a combination of tools from nonlinear dynamics, control theory, network science, data-driven equation discovery, and machine learning to *study* real-world and artificially intelligent systems and to *design* decentralized control strategies for autonomous teams. You can reach me at anastasiab [at] cornell [dot] edu 

**If you are attending the 2024 Conference on Decision and Control in Milan, Italy, check out our full-day pre-conference workshop on the [synthesis of bifurcation and systems theories for the design, analysis, and control of intelligent and collective behaviors](https://sites.google.com/view/cdc2024-bifurcations-workshop), co-organized with [Alessio Franci](https://sites.google.com/site/francialessioac/). The workshop is on December 15th and open for registration to all CDC attendees!**

Through June of 2024 I was postdoctoral scholar with the [AI Institute in Dynamic Systems](http://dynamicsai.org/) at the University of Washington, working with Professors [Steve Brunton](https://www.eigensteve.com/) and [J. Nathan Kutz](https://amath.washington.edu/people/j-nathan-kutz). Before joining the University of Washington, I received my Ph.D. in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering from Princeton University in September 2022. At Princeton my research on nonlinear dynamics of collective decision-making and belief formation was supervised by Professor [Naomi Ehrich Leonard](https://naomi.princeton.edu/). My dissertation research was distinguished with the [Princeton School of Applied Science and Engineering Award for Excellence](https://engineering.princeton.edu/news/2021/12/08/award-excellence-honors-graduate-student-achievement-2). You can read my Ph.D thesis [here](https://naomi.princeton.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/744/2022/09/AnastasiaThesis.pdf). Prior to my Ph.D. I earned a B.A. in Physics with a minor in Mechanical Engineering from the University of California, Berkeley in 2016.
