Hello world! I am a researcher fascinated by the mathematics of **collective behavior** that emerges from simple interactions of dynamic components, such as collective decision-making in human and animal social groups, pattern formation in networks of neurons, and self-organization in biological and technological swarms.  I believe **nonlinearity** is fundamentally important for understanding the properties of collective behavior that are shared  by systems across different contexts. In my work I combine ideas from nonlinear dynamical systems, control theory, network science, and distributed learning to both *understand* how emergent collective properties arise in real-world systems (e.g. human social networks) and to *design* new agent-based rules for **decentralized control** of complex self-organizing behaviors in autonomous technological swarms (e.g. robotic teams and mobile sensor networks). 

In October 2022 I started my current postdoctoral position with the [AI Institute in Dynamic Systems](http://dynamicsai.org/) at the University of Washington, working with Professors [Steve Brunton](https://www.eigensteve.com/) and [J. Nathan Kutz](https://amath.washington.edu/people/j-nathan-kutz). I am starting to investigate how data-driven methods for learning and forecasting of nonlinear dynamical systems can be leveraged for system identification and control of collective behavior. If you would like to explore potential collaboration at some intersection of collective behavior, swarm intelligence, control, distributed learning, and nonlinear systems, please reach out to me at *anabiz [at] uw [dot] edu*. 

I received my Ph.D. in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering from Princeton University in September 2022. At Princeton my research on nonlinear dynamics of collective decision-making and belief formation was supervised by Professor [Naomi Ehrich Leonard](https://naomi.princeton.edu/). You can read my Ph.D thesis [here](https://naomi.princeton.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/744/2022/09/AnastasiaThesis.pdf). Prior to my Ph.D. I earned a B.A. in physics with a minor in mechanical engineering from the University of California, Berkeley in 2016.
