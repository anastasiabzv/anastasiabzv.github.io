Hello! I'm a researcher fascinated by the mathematics of **collective behavior** and **distributed computation**, including human and animal social decision-making, pattern formation in networked and spatiotemporal systems, and self-organization in swarms. My focus is on **nonlinearity** and how it shapes emergent collective properties shared by systems across different contexts. I use a combination of tools from nonlinear dynamics, control theory, network science, and distributed learning to *study* collective behavior in real-world systems and to *design* decentralized control strategies for coordinating autonomous teams. 

In October 2022 I started my current postdoctoral position with the [AI Institute in Dynamic Systems](http://dynamicsai.org/) at the University of Washington, working with Professors [Steve Brunton](https://www.eigensteve.com/) and [J. Nathan Kutz](https://amath.washington.edu/people/j-nathan-kutz). I am investigating how data-driven methods for learning and forecasting of nonlinear dynamical systems can be leveraged for system identification and control of collective behavior. If you would like to explore potential collaboration at some intersection of collective behavior, swarm intelligence, control, distributed learning, and nonlinear systems, please reach out to me at *anabiz [at] uw [dot] edu*. 

Before joining the University of Washington, I received my Ph.D. in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering from Princeton University in September 2022. At Princeton my research on nonlinear dynamics of collective decision-making and belief formation was supervised by Professor [Naomi Ehrich Leonard](https://naomi.princeton.edu/). You can read my Ph.D thesis [here](https://naomi.princeton.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/744/2022/09/AnastasiaThesis.pdf). Prior to my Ph.D. I earned a B.A. in Physics with a minor in Mechanical Engineering from the University of California, Berkeley in 2016.
